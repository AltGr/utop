A universal toplevel for OCaml.

url: https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/utop/

* Requirements:

  utop depends on the following packages:

  * findlib      (http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html)
  * react        (http://erratique.ch/software/react)
  * lwt          (http://ocsigen.org/lwt/)
  * camomile     (http://camomile.sourceforge.net/)
  * zed          (http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/zed/)
  * lambda-term  (http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/lambda-term/)

  Lwt must be compiled with react support, configure it with:

    $ ./configure --enable-react

  utop also requires OCaml compiler libraries. If you are using
  debian, they are available as the package ocaml-compiler-libs, if
  you are using godi, they are installed by default. If you installed
  ocaml by hand, you can run the script utils/install-compiler-libs.sh.

* Installation:

  To compile and install lambda-term just type:

    $ ocaml setup.ml -configure
    $ ocaml setup.ml -build
    $ ocaml setup.ml -install

  If you get the development version of utop you must obtain oasis
  (http://oasis.forge.ocamlcore.org/).

* Usage:

  To use utop, simply run:

    $ utop

  utop display a bar after the prompt which is used to show possible
  completions in real-time. You can navigate in it using Alt+Left and
  Alt+Right, and select one completion using Alt+Tab.

* Customization:

  To add colors to utop, copy one of the files utoprc-dark or
  utoprc-light to ~/.utoprc. utoprc-dark is for terminals with dark
  colors (such as white on black) and utoprc-light is for terminals
  with light colors (such as black on white).

  You can also customize the prompt of utop by setting the reference
  UTop.prompt.

* Integration with emacs:

  To use utop in emacs, add the following line to your ~/.emacs file:

    (autoload 'utop "utop" "Toplevel for OCaml" t)

  Then you can run utop by executing the command "utop" in emacs.

* Integration with the tuareg/typerex mode:

  You can replace the default toplevel used by the tuareg or typerex
  mode by utop, for that add the following lines to your ~/.emacs
  file:

    (autoload 'utop-setup-ocaml-buffer "utop" "Toplevel for OCaml" t)
    (add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 'utop-setup-ocaml-buffer)
    (add-hook 'typerex-mode-hook 'utop-setup-ocaml-buffer)

* Development:

  The last development version of utop can always be found in the
  darcs repository hosted at darcs.ocamlcore.org:

  $ darcs get http://darcs.ocamlcore.org/repos/utop
